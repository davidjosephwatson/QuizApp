# QuizApp
https://davidjosephwatson.github.io/QuizApp/Master/

I built this app from scratch utilizing a mobile first design. Itâ€™s comprised of ten questions with a result screen at the end of the quiz. After each question, the user is provided feedback on whether the response was correct or not. The focus is on responsive design and functionality through JavaScript and JQuery.
